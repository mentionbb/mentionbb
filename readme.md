## A classic forum system with next-gen.

Plugin system works via HTML/CSS marker. In addition, with its advanced infrastructure and modular structure, you will never have any difficulties in your projects. Want a Portal? You can add. Blog? You can add.

- **Languages!** It was developed for you to adapt it to absolutely any language you want. Adding language is easy and simple, language files are very simple and you can also convert them to any sentence from the admin panel.

- **It's a nice theme but you can change it.** The default theme is responsive and built with many new technologies, but you can customize this theme or replace it completely.
